CS 189 UGSI Materials
===================

I was a Undergraduate Student Instructor for CS 189/289A (Introduction to Machine Learning) with Jonathan Shewchuk in Spring 2017. Contained in this repo are some of the notes I prepared for each discussion section (once per week), along with a paper I co-wrote with Noah Golmant on the univariate and multivariate Gaussian.
